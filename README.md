## Notes

Getting the games cards to display was an issue. Making sure they populated the right way was a bit difficult as it required calling on the id in the document which I forgot how to do at first. 

Making use of the ternary operator was awkward at first because I had to ensure the syntax was correct and it got slightly confusing since I had to include a sentence while writing that specific line of code. Also understanding what part of the if-statement went where while using the operator.
